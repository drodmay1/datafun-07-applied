# 44608 - project 7 Predictive Analytics w/SLR

## Overview
In module 7 machine learning (ML) was employed. At a high-level, supervised learning has been employed also simple linear regression, to train a model and use the resulting model (a "best-fit" straight line) to make predictions. The guided projects 10.16, 15.4 and 15.5 were implemented from textbook Intro to python (Paul Dietel and Harvey Dietel).

## Objective
- Build a model
- Make predictions
- Visualize the model
- Publish insights

## Environment setup
Create repo in github
name: datafun-07-applied.ipynb

### clone rep to local with git
``git clone https://github.com/drodmay1/datafun-07-applied.git``

### create virtual env with .venv
``python3 -m venv .venv``

### activate virtual environment
``source .venv/bin/activate``

## create a new notebook in vscode
datadun-07-ML

## Deliverable Names
GitHub Repository: datafun-07-ml
Documentation: README.md
Jupyter Notebook: david_ml.ipynb
requirements.txt
Chapter10 data - Data for textbook examples
Chapter15 data - Data for testbook examples

## External Dependencies imported
Virtual environment created and activated
jupyterlab
pandas
pyarrow
matplotlib
seaborn

## Version Control with Git
Repository created in GitHub named datafun-07-applied
Repository cloned to my local machine.

## Install dependencies in .venv
```python
pip intall jupyterlab
pip install pandas
pip install pyarrow
pip install matplotlib
pip intasll seaborn
pip install scipy
pip install stats
```

## Start of the project
- Jupyter notebook was created: david_eda.ipynb
- Title and introduction added
- Markdown cells added
- Used git pull
```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import pyarrow
import matplotlib
import seaborn
import scipy
```
## Work throught Chapter 10
### CC 7.5:  Chart a Straight Line (Part 1)
- Add a Markdown heading for Part 1 - Chart a Straight Line
- Follow the instructions from 10.16 (starting page 414).
- Use Markdown cells to create section headings as you work. 
- Use pandas DataFrames to plot Celsius vs Fahrenheit 

### CC 7.6:  Predict Avg High Temp in NYC in January (Part 2)
- Section 1 - Data Acquisition
- Section 2 - Data Inspection
- Section 3 - Data Cleaning 
- Section 4 - Descriptive Statistics
- Section 5 - Build the Model
- Section 6 - Predict
- Section 7 - Visualizations

### CC 7.7: Predict Avg High Temp in NYC in January (Part 3)
- Section 1 - Build the Model
- Section 2 - Test the Model
- Section 3 - Predict 
- Section 4 - Visualizations

### CC 7.8: Insights (Part 4)
- Publish Insights

### Optional Bonus - California Housing Dataset
- Loading the data
- Training and testing the data
- Visualizing the data
- Choosing the best model from the 4 listed.
